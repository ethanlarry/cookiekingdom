# cookiekingdom

During the creation of this mini project, I went through a couple website ideas. These including a generic contact me page and a site where you can purchase farmer 
grown non-GMO oranges. But after brainstorming, I decided on a gourmet cookie website. Why might you ask? Well a Crumbl Cookies near me has recently started it's 
construction so I thought, "Why not make a cookie website." After finalizing on the idea, it was time to code this website. Through making this website I learned
how to use the form element as well as the label, input, and button tag. I addition, I learned how to manipulate the border-radius value to give me the desired look 
I wanted. The thing that makes my website stand out is the in-your-face title. I'm not sure how user friendly this is but it gives a confident and bold feeling to
the page.
