# CookieKingdom

# Description

Cookie Kingdom is a gourmet cookie service where if you sign up through the web page, you can recieve a free sample of chocolate chip cookies. Through making this website I learned how to use the <form> element as well as the <label>, <input>, and <button> tags. In addition, I discovered how to manipulate the border-radius value to give me the desired look for the project. The thing that makes my website stand out is the in-your-face title. This gives a confident and bold feeling to the page.
